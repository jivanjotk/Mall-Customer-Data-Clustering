## Introduction
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics. It helps businesses understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms to segment customers based on their spending behavior.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- Age: Age of the customer
- Gender: Gender of the customer
- Average Income: Average income of the customer
- Spending Score: Spending score assigned to the customer

## Problem Statement
The goal is to analyze the relationship between spending score and gender, as well as spending score and income, and segment customers based on their spending behavior.

## Approach
We approach the problem in the following steps:
1. Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale the features if necessary.
2. Exploratory data analysis: Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and relationships between them.
3. Customer segmentation: Use machine learning algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative clustering to segment customers based on spending behavior.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the clustering algorithms using metrics such as silhouette score and visual inspection of clusters.
5. Interpretation: Interpret the results and provide insights for marketing strategies.

## File Descriptions
- `customer_segmentation_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and code.
- `mall_customers.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.


## Results
The analysis reveals insights into customer segmentation based on spending behavior, including the relationship between spending score and gender, and spending score and income.
